## How to resume

```bash
git pull
npm install          # in case deps changed
# launch the studio (see PLASMA_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md / package.json scripts)
```

## Where things stand

All work through **M2 hardening** is done and pushed: core `PlasmaRenderer` at WebGL1
parity, the studio app (artboard, docks, dropdowns, export modals, OKLCH), overlay +
seeded randomize, history nav, share links, exporters (PNG / two-mode video / embed),
Playwright visual goldens, and the recent fluid-displacement and still-image/video-export
fixes.

Latest work: WebCodecs MP4 export (M4 complete) — see the section below.

## Done — post-effects pipeline (2026-06-22)

Bloom ("Shining") / Blur / Glass / Pixelate now ship as a stackable post-process
chain between the plasma FBO and the gradient composite. Implemented test-first:

- **Core:** `effects` config block (zod, clamped, all-off default) in
  [config.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/config.ts) + [config-defaults.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/config-defaults.ts);
  new [effects.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/effects.ts) (`EffectChain` class + GLSL
  passes + `planPasses`/`bloomBrightWeight` helpers); "Effects" lock group in
  [randomize.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/randomize.ts) (surprise-me rolls them lightly);
  chain wired into [renderer.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/renderer.ts).
- **UI:** [EffectsControls.tsx](apps/studio/src/panels/controls/EffectsControls.tsx) +
  `PARAMS` in [spec.ts](apps/studio/src/panels/controls/spec.ts) + Effects section in
  [RightPanel.tsx](apps/studio/src/panels/RightPanel.tsx).
- **Reach:** effects run in studio, PNG/video export, AND the `<plasma-bg>` embed
  (they share `PlasmaRenderer`). Embed bundle 13.58 KB gzip, under the 15 KB budget.
  This deviates from the spec's "embed out of scope" — see the spec's Implementation note.
- **Tests:** unit (config round-trip/clamp, effects pass-order/bloom math, lock group)
  + 5 new Playwright goldens (one per effect + a stacked combo). Full suite + build green.

> Heads-up: the embed budget now has only ~1.4 KB gzip headroom. Watch it if you add
> more effect shaders.

## Done — WebCodecs MP4 export (2026-06-23) → M4 complete

`exportVideo` now emits real H.264 **MP4** via WebCodecs, rendered *faster than
realtime*, and transparently falls back to the existing MediaRecorder **WebM**
path where WebCodecs is unavailable. This completes **Milestone 4** (post pipeline
+ WebCodecs MP4). Implemented test-first per
[the plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-webcodecs-mp4-export.md):

- **Core:** new backend in [video-webcodecs.ts](packages/core/src/exporters/video-webcodecs.ts)
  (`pickH264Codec` probes High→Main→Baseline via `isConfigSupported`;
  `exportVideoWebCodecs` encodes `VideoFrame`s and muxes MP4 with `mp4-muxer`,
  no realtime pacing, `encodeQueueSize` backpressure, `endExport`/`frame.close`
  in `finally`). [video.ts](packages/core/src/exporters/video.ts) gains
  `supportsWebCodecs()`, a shared `renderFrameToCanvas` compositor, and an
  `exportVideo` dispatcher; the old body is preserved as `exportVideoMediaRecorder`.
- **UI:** [VideoExportModal.tsx](apps/studio/src/panels/export/VideoExportModal.tsx)
  — backend-neutral "rendering N%" wording + a read-only "MP4 · H.264 / WebM"
  caption. No new controls; format selection is automatic.
- **Reach & budget:** `mp4-muxer` is in `packages/core` only and imported solely by
  the exporters, so it does NOT reach the `<plasma-bg>` embed — embed still 13.58 KB
  gzip. (Studio bundle grew ~10 KB gzip, which is fine — only the embed is budgeted.)
- **Tests:** unit (`pickH264Codec` selection, `supportsWebCodecs` branches, dispatch
  routing) + a Playwright check that drives `exportVideo` in real Chromium and
  asserts a `video/mp4` blob with an `ftyp` box. Full suite green: 81 unit, 14 visual.

> Heads-up: `mp4-muxer@5.2.2` is npm-deprecated (successor: `mediabunny`) — it works
> and its API is intact, but consider migrating. It also pulls `@types/dom-webcodecs`
> as a transitive runtime dep.

## Done — keyframe timeline (M5 v1) (2026-06-23)

In-studio keyframe timeline that morphs whole-look snapshots over time, with live
preview and video export of the morph. First half of **Milestone 5**. Implemented
test-first per [the plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-keyframe-timeline.md):

- **Core (pure):** [timeline.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/timeline.ts) —
  `lerpConfig` (explicit field-by-field: numbers/tuples lerp, palette + hex colors
  mix in OKLab via the existing `oklabMix`, discrete fields hard-switch at the t=0.5
  midpoint), `applyEasing` (linear / ease-in / ease-out / ease-in-out), and
  `sampleTimeline(timeline, time)`. `rgb2hex` added to
  [palette.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/palette.ts). Zero-dependency.
- **Two clocks:** the plasma's motion time keeps running while timeline time morphs
  the *look* — both advance during playback.
- **Studio:** [useTimelineStore](apps/studio/src/stores/timeline.ts) (2–6 keyframes,
  capture/move/delete/easing/duration); a rAF playback loop
  ([timelinePlayback.ts](apps/studio/src/lib/timelinePlayback.ts)) that drives the
  renderer DIRECTLY (no config-store writes, no per-frame React render; pause restores
  the authoring look); a bottom
  [TimelineStrip](apps/studio/src/panels/timeline/TimelineStrip.tsx) (track + pips +
  playhead + transport).
- **Export:** `VideoOpts.timeline?` — when set, the shared `renderFrameToCanvas`
  re-samples the config per frame (both MP4 and WebM backends). The modal opts in when
  ≥2 keyframes exist and warns that seamless loops need matching first/last keyframes.
- **Tests:** unit for lerp/easing/sample + the store; a deterministic 2-keyframe
  midpoint Playwright golden. Full suite green: 103 unit (88 core + 15 studio), 15 visual;
  embed unchanged at 13.58 KB (timeline code stays out of the embed).

> Follow-ups (own specs): audio reactivity, crossfading discrete (motion/material)
> changes instead of hard-cut, a second engine. Small polish: the export filename uses
> the manual duration, not the timeline duration, for timeline exports.

## Done — embed runtime API (M5 v2) (2026-06-24)

Runtime animation API on the `<plasma-bg>` custom element, completing the second
deliverable of **Milestone 5**. Implemented test-first per
[the plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-24-embed-runtime-api.md):

- **API surface:** `set(patch)`, `animateTo(patch, opts)`, `timeline(tl)`, `play({loop})`,
  `pause()`, `seek(t)`, `getConfig()`, `progress`. All config inputs are deep-merged
  partial patches (no full config required). Drivers are mutually exclusive — every entry
  point cancels the active driver before starting.
- **Core (zod-free):** [timeline.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/timeline.ts) gains
  `lerpConfigRaw` and `sampleTimelineRaw` (raw-typed, no zod); new
  [merge.ts](packages/core/src/plasma/merge.ts) exports `mergeConfigPatch` (deep-merge
  over current look). The embed reuses the studio's morph math without pulling zod.
- **Controller:** new [packages/embed/src/controller.ts](packages/embed/src/controller.ts)
  (`PlasmaController`) owns a single rAF morph driver. `seek` is stateless for
  external scrubbing. Two clocks are preserved: the plasma's motion time runs
  independently while the controller sets only the *look* config.
- **Reduced-motion:** `animateTo` snaps instantly; `play` stills on the first keyframe;
  `set`/`seek` are unaffected.
- **Bundle budget raised:** 15 KB → **16.5 KB gzip** (decision 2026-06-24) to ship the
  full API and OKLab color quality in one bundle. Hard gate enforced by
  [packages/embed/scripts/check-size.mjs](packages/embed/scripts/check-size.mjs) (build
  fails at ≥ 16.5 KB). Current size: **15.70 KB gzip**.
- **Demo:** [packages/embed/demo/](packages/embed/demo/) — autoplay timeline loop +
  GSAP ScrollTrigger scroll-scrub (GSAP via CDN only; no embed bundle impact).
- **Tests:** 124 unit tests (99 core + 10 embed + 15 studio), 16 visual test cases
  (15 screenshot goldens — including the new `embed-seek-midpoint` — + the MP4 probe).
  Full suite green.

> Remaining M5 work: engine #2 (mesh gradient, or reaction-diffusion as the more
> distinctive alternative — see §9 in PLASMA_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md).

> Heads-up: `packages/embed/package.json` currently points `main`/`types`/`exports`
> at `./src/plasma-bg.ts` so the studio can import the source directly for the
> Playwright golden harness. Before any external npm publish this should be split:
> external consumers should get the built `dist/plasma-bg.js`, not raw TypeScript.

## Next ideas (backlog)

Effects extensions noted as out-of-scope in the post-effects spec: chromatic
aberration, vignette, per-effect presets, WebGL2/float FBOs. Plus: migrate the MP4
muxer off deprecated `mp4-muxer` to `mediabunny`; optional 4K export tier (now cheap
with faster-than-realtime WebCodecs); M5 remaining: engine #2 (mesh gradient or
reaction-diffusion). See [PLASMA_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md](PLASMA_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md).
